# HybridSynchAADL

HybridSynchAADL (Hybrid Synchronous AADL) is a verification tool which presents
HybridSynchAADL modeling language and formal analysis for virtually synchronous
cyber-physical systems with complex control programs, continuous behaviors, and
bounded clock skews, network delays, and execution times.


HybridSynchAADL models are given a formal semantics and analyzed using Maude
with SMT solving, which allows us to represent advanced control programs and
communication features in Maude, while capturing timing uncertainties and
continuous behaviors symbolically with SMT solving.
